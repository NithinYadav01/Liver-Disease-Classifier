# Liver-Disease-Classifier
 In this project,The Indian Liver Patient Records dataset from Kaggle will be used in this project. Based on specific features, we will determine whether or not a patient has liver disease. We will ascertain whether or not the condition is linked to the total proteins, albumin, etc.
# Dataset
The data collection was gathered from the northeast region of Andhra Pradesh, India, and includes 416 records of liver patients and 167 records of non-liver patients. Groups are classified as either liver patients (liver disease) or not (no disease) based on the class label "Dataset" in the column. There are 142 patient records for women and 441 patient records for men in this data collection.

Patients who are older than 89 are identified as being "90" years old

# Results
The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) has been found to be the most effective for liver disease prediction. Its superior performance over other algorithms such as KNN, random forest, and logistic regression, indicates that SVC is the best choice for live disease prediction. Its ability to efficiently handle large datasets, its robustness to noise, and its high accuracy make it an ideal choice for such applications. With SVC, we can make more accurate predictions in real time, which can help in early detection of diseases and improve patient outcomes

# Conclusion

In summary, machine learning is becoming more crucial in healthcare research, especially in studying liver diseases. These algorithms analyze big sets of data, find patterns, and make predictions, helping us discover new information about what causes liver diseases and how to treat them. In the future, we expect to see more use of machine learning in this field, playing a big part in enhancing our understanding of this important health issue.
