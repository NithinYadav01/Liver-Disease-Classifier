# Liver-Disease-Classifier
# In this project,The Indian Liver Patient Records dataset from Kaggle will be used in this project. Based on specific features, we will determine whether or not a patient has liver disease. We will ascertain whether or not the condition is linked to the total proteins, albumin, etc.
# Dataset
The data collection was gathered from the northeast region of Andhra Pradesh, India, and includes 416 records of liver patients and 167 records of non-liver patients. Groups are classified as either liver patients (liver disease) or not (no disease) based on the class label "Dataset" in the column. There are 142 patient records for women and 441 patient records for men in this data collection.

Patients who are older than 89 are identified as being "90" years old
